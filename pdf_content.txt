BINDING CONSTRAINT
CoWoS Packaging
Not wafers - limits supply through 2027
Supply-Constrained Through 2027
Packaging and HBM capacity - not demand or capital - limit deployment speed. 
Hyperscalers have committed $200B+ in capex.
Grid Interconnection Becomes Binding Post-2028
As CoWoS scales to 200K+ WPM and HBM4 enters production, constraint shifts to 3-
7 year utility interconnection timelines.
No Power Surplus in Any Scenario
Even if AI business case weakens, existing commitments and base case inference 
demand ensure deficit through 2035.
Methodology: Wafer → Package → TDP → GW
Explicit modeling through CoWoS constraints, chip TDP mix, server overhead 
(1.45x), utilization (60-80%), and PUE (1.12-1.4).

No Power Surplus in Any Scenario
The critical infrastructure planning implication
Even under Scenario B (AI business case fails to materialize), U.S. data center power demand reaches 85-110 GW by 2035 — still 
requiring 4-6x growth from current infrastructure.
1. COMMITTED CAPITAL
$200B+ already committed by hyperscalers for 
2024-2026 deployment. These data centers will be 
built regardless of demand trajectory changes.
2. INFERENCE BASELINE
Current AI applications (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) 
have 100M+ users. Maintaining service at current 
quality requires sustained infrastructure.
3. CLOUD MIGRATION
Traditional enterprise workloads continue migrating 
to hyperscale DCs at 15%+ CAGR — independent 
of AI demand trajectory.

IMPLICATION FOR INFRASTRUCTURE
Power infrastructure investment is a low-regret strategy through 2030. 
The question is not if demand will materialize, but how much beyond 
baseline projections.

Resolution: BTM power, nuclear, transmission upgrades
Strategic implication: Infrastructure planning must address the constraint expected to be binding at time of deployment, not today's constraint. Projects starting in 
2025 face grid constraints at completion.
Strategic Implications
1. NEAR-TERM: LOW-REGRET
2024-2028 infrastructure commitments needed under both scenarios.
2. TIMING IS CRITICAL
Grid interconnection takes 3-7 years. Projects today deliver into 2028-2032 crunch.
3. BTM BRIDGING OPPORTUNITY
$120-140/MWh BTM power bridges 2027-2030 grid gap.
4. GEOGRAPHIC ARBITRAGE
TX, OK, Midwest offer 2-3 year advantages over VA, GA.
Bottom Line: 10-15x increase in AI power demand through 2035. No scenario produces a power surplus. Infrastructure 
development is the rate-limiting factor.

DEMAND SCENARIO B: PLATEAU
Business case doesn't materialize → 85 GW by 2030, 95 GW by 2035
SCENARIO COMBINATION 2027 2030 2035 ASSESSMENT
Low Supply × Demand A -25 GW -65 GW -90 GW MOST LIKELY ★
Low Supply × Demand B -10 GW -35 GW +45 GW Tight then surplus
Med Supply × Demand A -15 GW -40 GW +27 GW Requires GETs/SMR

High Supply × Demand A -5 GW -15 GW +188 GW Achievable if aggressive
High Supply × Demand B +10 GW +15 GW +323 GW Major surplus
CRITICAL FINDING
Under the most likely combination (Low Supply × Demand A), the U.S. faces a 65 GW deficit by 2030 that widens to 90 GW by 2035. This reflects utility delivery 
slippage and minimal reliance on unproven GETs/SMR deployment.

Strategic Implications: Supply-Demand Analysis
Infrastructure delivery is the binding constraint through 2030
The fundamental physics of power system development — 5-year queue timelines, 5-7 year equipment lead times, 10-year major 
transmission projects — cannot be compressed by policy or capital alone. AI data center buildout will proceed at the speed of infrastructure 
delivery.
GEOGRAPHIC ARBITRAGE 
ACCELERATES
Texas permits 3x faster than California. ERCOT queues 
are more efficient despite growth. Deregulated markets 
offer faster delivery despite reliability concerns. 
Southeast's vertically integrated model offers a middle 
path — slower but more reliable.
→ TX, OK have 2-3 year advantage
BTM GENERATION ESSENTIAL
With widening deficit through 2035+, on-site generation 
is not optional but essential: nuclear PPAs, gas island 
microgrids, co-located renewables + storage. Higher 
capital intensity but bypasses decade-long 
interconnection constraints.
→ $120-140/MWh BTM viable indefinitely
DEFICIT WIDENS THROUGH 2035
Under LOW supply scenario (proven tech only), gap 
grows from -25 GW (2027) to -90 GW (2035). No 
crossover within forecast window. Seller's market for 
power capacity. Sustained high capacity prices. 
Ongoing reliability concerns.
→ Persistent structural shortage
BOTTOM LINE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTORS
Power infrastructure investment is a low-regret strategy through 2035+. The question is not if demand will 
materialize, but how much beyond baseline. Even Scenario B (plateau) requires 85-110 GW by 2035 — 4-6x 
growth from current levels.
LOW SCENARIO ASSUMPTIONS
No GETs adoption acceleration
SMRs: restarts only, no new builds
Utility delivery slips 2028→2031
Most Likely Scenario: Supply vs Demand (U.S.)
Low Supply × Demand A | Based on utility feedback and proven technologies only
Orange = Demand | Cyan = Supply | Gap widens through 2035
LOW SUPPLY SCENARIO
Proven technologies only. No reliance on GETs 
adoption or SMR commercialization. Reflects 
2028→2031 utility slippage.

Geographic Demand Distribution
U.S. Technology Stack demand ≠ U.S.-located power demand
THE DISTINCTION
U.S. TECHNOLOGY STACK (75-80% OF GLOBAL)
Chips designed by NVIDIA, AMD, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, 
Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm — regardless of where deployed
↓
U.S. DOMESTIC DEPLOYMENT (~70%)
Power demand that materializes within U.S. borders — training concentration, 
North American inference, security preferences
INTERNATIONAL OVERSPILL (~30%)
Demand forced overseas by U.S. power constraints — GDPR requirements, 
sovereign AI initiatives, latency optimization
THE "PRESSURE COOKER" EFFECT
Full stack demand represents pressure on the U.S. system. Capacity that 
wants to be here but is forced overseas. Any deliverable U.S. capacity is 
immediately absorbed at scarcity premium.
WHY ~70% STAYS DOMESTIC
Training Concentration
Frontier models require proximity to research teams, IP security. 80%+ of 
training stays U.S.
North American Market
Largest demand market. Central U.S. serves continent with acceptable latency 
(30-50ms).
Ecosystem Depth
HV electricians, commissioning engineers, EPC capacity concentrated in U.S.
WHY ~30% GOES INTERNATIONAL
U.S. Power Constraints
5-9 year queues force hyperscalers to seek deliverable power abroad.
Sovereign AI / Data Residency
GDPR mandates local deployment. UAE, Saudi, France, UK funding sovereign 
clouds.
Global Inference Latency
Europe (70ms+) and Asia (150ms+) from U.S. require regional hubs.
OVERSPILL DESTINATIONS
Middle East 10-15%
UAE, Saudi — cheap power, fast permitting, serves 
Europe/Africa/South Asia
Europe 8-12%
Nordics, UK, Ireland — GDPR compliance, renewable power
Asia-Pacific 5-8%
Japan, Singapore, Australia — regional inference hubs
CRITICAL: SAME SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS
International sites face identical equipment bottlenecks: 5-7 year gas 
turbine lead times, 2-4 year transformer delays. Building in UAE 
competes for the same GE/Siemens capacity as Oklahoma.
IMPLICATION
Overspill destinations don't relieve pressure — they queue behind it. 
U.S. capacity remains scarce and premium-priced.
Domestic share range: Estimates vary from 55-80% depending on sovereign AI acceleration and U.S. supply responsiveness. 70% is base case. Higher U.S. share = larger domestic deficit. Lower share still leaves 30-50 GW shortfall.
Recalibrated U.S. Supply vs Demand
Even with 30% international overspill, structural U.S. deficit persists through 2035
Total U.S. Stack Demand U.S. Domestic Demand (70%) U.S. Supply (Low Trend)
DEFICIT ANALYSIS
2030
Stack Demand: 115 GW
Domestic (70%): 81 GW
U.S. Supply: 50 GW
U.S. Deficit: -31 GW
2035
Stack Demand: 230 GW
Domestic (70%): 161 GW
U.S. Supply: 140 GW
U.S. Deficit: -21 GW
THE GAP BETWEEN LINES
Orange → Green = demand forced overseas by U.S. constraints. Green → 
Cyan = persistent domestic deficit requiring fast-to-power solutions.
INTERNATIONAL DEMAND = SAME SUPPLY CHAIN PRESSURE
The ~35 GW of 2030 overspill competes for the same gas turbines, transformers, and HV equipment. International buildout does not relieve global manufacturing constraints — it adds to them. GE, Siemens, Hitachi backlogs serve global demand.

IMPERATIVE
Speed of Execution
Strategic Imperatives
Core framework for powered land development 2026-2027
PILLAR 1
Giga-Scale Mandate
Focus exclusively on 1GW+ Energy Hubs — smaller sites 
cannot achieve BTM economies of scale or meet 
hyperscaler cluster requirements.
KEY DRIVERS
AI training requires contiguous capacity
1GW commands higher $/MW premium
BTM gas economics require scale
Effort-to-yield ratio maximized
PILLAR 2
Geographic Arbitrage
Prioritize speed-to-power over proximity to traditional 
markets. Generation queue efficiency now drives site 
selection.
PRIORITY REGIONS
P1: Central Belt (OK, AR, WY) — 2-3 yr
P2: Rust Belt (WV, IN, OH, PA) — 4-5 yr
P3: ERCOT Secondary (TX) — 3-4 yr
Avoid: CA, NoVA, NE, NY — 6-9+ yr
PILLAR 3
BTM / Power Island
Assume the grid will be late. Design all campuses with 
BTM capability from inception. Reliance on grid alone is a 
failing strategy.
EXECUTION ELEMENTS
Gas pipeline access mandatory
Brownfield sites (coal retirement)
Dual-fuel capability standard
Battery storage complement
CORE THESIS
Your value proposition: delivering complex, integrated energy solutions faster than hyperscalers can themselves.
Strategic Partnership Model
Partnering for BTM capability rather than building IPP infrastructure in-house
THE STRATEGIC CHOICE
BUILD (HIGH RISK)
In-house energy trading, fuel procurement, 
generation O&M
PARTNER (RECOMMENDED)
With established IPPs who bring capital, 
expertise, risk capacity
IDEAL PARTNER PROFILES
Major IPPs: Talen, Vistra, NRG, Calpine — generation fleet, trading desks, fuel contracts
Infrastructure Funds: Stonepeak, EIG, KKR Infra — patient capital, energy expertise
Utility Affiliates: AEP Energy Partners, NextEra — regulatory relationships, balance sheet
O&M Specialists: Mitsubishi Power, GE Vernova — turbine supply + long-term service
PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURES
Development Partner
You contribute: site control, entitlements, utility relationships, end-user pipeline
Partner contributes: generation development, fuel, O&M, capital
PPA + Tolling Structure
IPP builds/owns BTM generation, sells power under long-term PPA to DC. You take spread on powered 
land.
Build-Transfer-Operate
Partner develops generation, transfers to DC owner/operator, retains long-term O&M contract.
YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION TO PARTNERS
Shovel-ready sites in low-queue states + utility relationships + end-user demand pipeline = de-risked development for IPP partners seeking DC exposure.

Binding Constraints Analysis
The brakes on development — assuming unlimited demand and capital
SUPPLY CHAIN
Physical Bottleneck
BTM strategy relies on gas turbines with 5-7 
year lead times. Projects initiated now receive 
equipment 2030-2032.
Gas Turbines: 5-7 yrs
Transformers: 2-4 yrs
Switchgear: 18-30 mo
LABOR FORCE
Human Bottleneck
Most significant localized constraint. These 
states lack deep specialized labor pools. A 
single 1GW campus requires 2,000+ workers.
Per 1GW Campus: 2,000+ workers
HV Electricians: Critical shortage
Commissioning: Critical shortage
GAS INFRASTRUCTURE
Pipeline Capacity
Resource-rich states but pipeline capacity for 
Giga-scale BTM not guaranteed. Local 
distribution insufficient.
Pipeline Upgrades: 2-4 yrs
Firm Transport: Contract required
OK/AR Access: Strong
UTILITY ABSORPTION
Pace of Scaling
Smaller utility balance sheets and less 
engineering bandwidth than coastal giants.
OG&E / PSO: Proactive
Entergy: Proactive
Concurrent GW Projects: Limited
Key Insight: You can buy turbines on secondary markets and fund transmission upgrades — but you cannot manufacture experienced HV electricians. Labor is the constraint most likely to bite.
Water vs Power: The Binary Divide
Why power is the fatal flaw and water is a design variable
POWER IS BINARY
0 or 1
Either you have firm capacity or you do not
No design workaround. A data center without power is a warehouse. Cannot be optimized, 
substituted, or engineered around.
CHARACTERISTICS
Generation queue position is irreversible
Timeline slippage = project death
No substitute for firm MW
BTM only option when grid fails
FATAL FLAW CRITERION
No power pathway = Kill the deal
WATER IS DESIGNABLE
70x Range
Technology choice drives consumption
Observed variation: End-user requirements range from 120K gal/day to 8M gal/day for 
equivalent 600-900MW campuses.
DESIGN LEVERS
Air cooling vs evaporative (10x delta)
Closed-loop liquid cooling (lowest)
Reclaimed / industrial water sources
BTM generation cooling technology
PLUS FACTOR
Water rights are valuable, but absence is manageable
LOW WATER DESIGN
120K - 500K gal/day
Air-cooled + closed-loop liquid | 600-900MW
HIGH WATER DESIGN
5M - 8M gal/day
Evaporative cooling + BTM thermal | 600MW
IMPLICATION
Water adds value but is not disqualifying. Design to context. 
Power has no substitute.
Strategic Risk Matrix
Second-order effects and hidden risks in BTM/Giga-scale strategy
GAS ISLAND RISK — HIGH
Firm transport does not equal firm delivery during extreme weather 
(Uri). Pipeline interruption = catastrophic downtime.
Mitigation: Dual-fuel capability, on-site LNG/diesel storage
STRANDED ASSET — MEDIUM
BTM gas conflicts with Net Zero commitments. By mid-2030s, risk 
of regulatory/customer-driven stranding.
Mitigation: H2-ready design (hedge only), CCUS optionality
POLITICAL BACKLASH — MEDIUM
Socialized infrastructure costs lead to residential rate shock, power 
hogs narrative, moratoriums.
Mitigation: Direct cost allocation, proactive PUC engagement
GAS PRICE VOLATILITY — MEDIUM
Henry Hub: $2-9/MMBtu range. At $4/MMBtu BTM compelling. At 
$8/MMBtu value proposition weakens.
Mitigation: Long-term hedging, fixed-price contracts
CLOSING WINDOW — HIGH
Geographic arbitrage is not proprietary. Rush to the Middle will 
erode speed advantages within 18-36 months.
Response: Lock down best sites, utility commitments NOW
TAIWAN BLACK SWAN — TAIL
55% of US AI capacity still fabbed in Taiwan 2030. Disruption halts 
new demand but existing infra value spikes.
Implication: Capacity online 2025-2028 = geopolitical hedge
Net Assessment: Risks are manageable with proper mitigation. The dominant risk is moving too slowly. Speed of execution remains the strategic imperative.
The Closing Window
18-36 month arbitrage opportunity — execution priorities for 2026-2027
ARBITRAGE WINDOW EROSION
2025-2026 — MAXIMUM ADVANTAGE
First movers secure best sites, utility relationships, labor
2027 — ERODING
QTS, Vantage, EdgeCore entering OK/TX secondary
2028+ — NORMALIZED
Arbitrage states saturated. Competing on cost.
OKLAHOMA POSITIONING
Sites in #1 ranked state offer 12-18 month advantage over competitors entering now. First movers 
capture utility relationships and queue positions.
EXECUTION PRIORITIES 2026-2027
1 Secure 3-5 Giga-Scale Sites
Deploy capital for queue positions, land control, utility LOIs
2 Lock Labor and Equipment
Secure HV electrical contractors, turbine positions
3 Deepen Utility Relationships
Embed in OG&E/PSO IRP planning, fund staff expansion
4 Build IPP Capability
Establish energy trading partnership or hire desk
The dominant risk is moving too slowly.
Every month of delay narrows the window. Capacity online 2027-2030 captures peak scarcity premium.
Site Selection Team: Execution Framework
Prioritized actions within your control — organized by impact and urgency
PRIORITY 1: IMMEDIATE (Q1 2026)
Queue Positions
File generation interconnection applications NOW
Fund feasibility studies to advance queue position
Every month delay = 1 month later delivery
Capital Readiness
Stage capital for rapid deployment on sites
Pre-approve land acquisition parameters
Opportunity cost of slow capital is site loss
Utility Relationships
Deepen OG&E/PSO/GRDA engagement
Participate in IRP planning processes
Relationship depth = timeline advantage
PRIORITY 2: NEAR-TERM (H1 2026)
IPP Partnerships
Initiate conversations with 3-5 target IPPs
Define JV term sheet templates
Critical for BTM execution capability
Economic Development
Build relationships with state/local EDCs
Identify incentive programs, expedited permitting
Political support accelerates timelines
Developer Partnerships
Formalize partnership models
Expand developer partner network
Execution capacity for parallel projects
PRIORITY 3: ENABLERS (2026)
DD Standardization
Create repeatable site evaluation checklist
Standardize power pathway assessment
Speed + consistency in evaluation
EPC / Technical MSA
Pre-negotiate MSA for DD
Rapid-deploy technical assessment capability
Eliminates procurement delay on new sites
End-User Pipeline
Expand hyperscaler relationship network
Track demand signals, RFP calendars
Demand visibility de-risks development
All items above are within your direct control. Priority 1 items are time-critical and compound — delay costs more than capital. Execute in parallel, not sequence.
Geographic Flexibility: Why Central Sites Work
70-85% of AI power demand is location-independent — power availability trumps proximity
THE PHYSICS OF LATENCY
Fiber Optic Speed: ~124 miles per millisecond
OKC → NYC
~22ms
1,330 miles
OKC → LA
~20ms
1,180 miles
Effective RTT with network overhead: 30-50ms to either coast
THE KEY INSIGHT
For Generative AI, processing latency (100-300ms) dominates network latency. Whether 
network adds 10ms (local) or 40ms (central) is imperceptible to users.
Total Latency = Network RTT + Processing Latency
WORKLOAD GEOGRAPHIC REQUIREMENTS
AI TRAINING
100% geographically flexible
Needs power, not proximity
GENAI INFERENCE
Chatbots, Copilots, Search
Flexible (40-100ms+ tolerance)
Dominant GW demand driver
LOW LATENCY
Gaming, AR/VR, AdTech
Needs regional proximity
Medium GW impact
ULTRA-LOW
AVs, Robotics, HFT
On-device or metro edge
Not centralized DC demand
STRATEGIC CONCLUSION
70-85% of forecasted AI power demand can be served from Central U.S. sites. Prioritize power availability over proximity. The caveat: sites must have diverse, high-capacity fiber routes to coastal 
exchange points.
Latency Spectrum: Workload Detail
The Hub-and-Spoke architecture validates Central Belt positioning for Giga-scale demand
CATEGORY THRESHOLD USE CASES LOCATION REQ GW IMPACT
Ultra-Low < 10ms Autonomous vehicles, industrial robotics, high-frequency trading On-device or metro edge Low
Low Latency 10-40ms Cloud gaming, complex AR/VR rendering, real-time AdTech Metro / Regional Medium
Medium Latency 40-100ms+ Generative AI (chatbots, copilots), search engines, recommendation engines Centralized / Continental VERY HIGH
Tolerant > 100ms Batch processing, scientific analysis, non-real-time content moderation Anywhere High
THE HUBS: AI Factories (Giga-Scale)
Location: Central U.S. (OK, AR, WY), Rust Belt
Function: All training + majority of inference
Optimized for: Power, cost, deliverability
THE SPOKES: Regional/Edge
Location: NoVA, Dallas, LA, Atlanta metros
Function: Low-latency inference, peering, caching
Optimized for: Proximity (10-200MW sites)
SITE SELECTION CRITERION
Add to DD checklist: Fiber connectivity
Require: Diverse routes to both coasts
Tulsa: Strong (legacy telecom hub)
CAVEAT: This analysis is most robust through 2030. Post-2030, if model inference speeds drop dramatically (to 20-50ms), network latency becomes relatively more important. For the 2026-2030 arbitrage window, power 
availability clearly dominates proximity.
The Queue Reality: Bimodal Value Distribution
Queue position ≠ value. The market is bifurcating into worthless speculation and premium deliverables.
THE FLOOD OF SPECULATION
90+ GW
PJM DC load requests
100+ 
GW
ERCOT large load
19%
Historical completion
Most queue entries are speculative — no land control, no end-user, no 
utility relationship, no execution capability. "Ghost projects" hoping to flip 
positions.
THE GREAT FILTER
FERC Order 2023
"First-Ready, First-Served" — higher deposits, readiness milestones, 
withdrawal penalties. Full implementation 2026 -27.
Escalating Costs
Study deposits, security postings, upgrade cost assignments — filters out 
undercapitalized speculators.
Utility Triage
Overwhelmed utilities prioritizing real projects with end-user commitment, 
land control, financial capability.
BIMODAL VALUE DISTRIBUTION
Worthless (~$0) Middle (uncertain) Premium ($1M+)
Not a continuum. Most positions worth ~$0. Few with right ingredients command 
premium.
THE BIFURCATION
THE "HAVE NOTS"
Weak queue, no infrastructure, 
undercapitalized. Will fail the filter. Value → $0.
THE "HAVES"
Full ingredients, utility commitment, end-user 
alignment. Unprecedented premiums.
VALUE BY STAGE $/MW (2025)
Queue only, no ingredients ~$0
Queue + land, no pathway $20-75K
Early real (utility engaged) $150-300K
Advancing (study + end-user) $300-500K
Committed (LOI + entitlements) $500K-1M
De-risked (36-mo certainty) $800K-1.5M+
Key insight: The $200K/MW in emerging markets isn't pricing a 
queue. It's pricing real ingredients and credible sponsors.
Strategic implication: Don't buy queue positions. Deploy ingredients. The margin is in transforming $0 optionality into $500K+ committed value through execution capability and relationships.
The Right Ingredients: What Creates Value
Queue position is table stakes. Value comes from the bundle that enables execution.
THE VALUE HIERARCHY
END-USER DEMAND
Hyperscaler commitment validates all
↓ validates
POWER PATHWAY
Utility commitment + transmission + queue
↓ enables
SITE FUNDAMENTALS
Land, water, fiber, zoning, BTM pathway
↓ supports
QUEUE POSITION ALONE
Worth very little without the above
THE INGREDIENTS CHECKLIST
Tier 1: Relationship Capital (Cannot Rush)
Utility trust, end-user pipeline, community relationships, political access
Build time: 2-5+ years. Must pre-exist.
Tier 2: Execution Capability
Transmission expertise, BTM knowledge, EPC relationships, track record
Differentiates serious players from speculators.
Tier 3: Financial Capability
Patient capital, $100M+ security posting, study funding, fast decisions
The "Great Filter" for undercapitalized speculators.
Tier 4: Site-Specific (Table Stakes)
Land control, queue position, water access, fiber connectivity
Acquirable with money. Necessary but not differentiating.
THE 12-18 MONTH SPRINT
Option Window Reality
12-18 months from land option to close or walk. Everything must happen 
in parallel.
Parallel Workstreams
Utility study, end-user LOI, zoning/permits, technical DD, financing — all 
simultaneous.
The Chicken-and-Egg
Utility wants end-user. End-user wants power. Zoning wants both. 
Someone must break cycle with credibility.
THE MOAT
Ability to execute parallel sprint — relationships + capability + capital in 
12-18 months.
Who can do this? Perhaps 10-20 organizations nationally have pre-existing relationships, execution capability, and capital to run the parallel sprint successfully.
Geographic Convergence: NoVA as the Ceiling
Location doesn't matter for AI workloads. Power does. Pricing will converge nationally.
WHY LOCATION DOESN'T MATTER
The Latency Reality
Processing latency (100-300ms) dominates network latency (30-50ms) 
for GenAI workloads.
OKC → NYC
~22ms
OKC → LA
~20ms
Workload Distribution
AI Training 100% location flexible
GenAI Inference 80%+ location flexible
Low-latency (gaming, AR) Regional required
70-85% of AI power demand can be served from Central U.S.
THE CONVERGENCE LOGIC
If location doesn't matter for the workload, and power is the binding 
constraint everywhere, then the price of deliverable power should 
converge nationally.

NOVA'S DYSFUNCTION = YOUR OPPORTUNITY
Every year NoVA gets more constrained and expensive, the case for 
Central Belt strengthens and convergence accelerates.
Note: Prices shown are for real sites with credible sponsors and utility engagement (not queue-only positions). Full parity unlikely due to ecosystem maturity discount (10-15%), but convergence to 70-85% of NoVA represents 2-4x appreciation

VALUE RISKS
↓ Hyperscaler capex pullback
↓ Supply response faster
↓ Efficiency gains reduce demand
↓ Interest rates compress multiples
Assumptions: Central Belt/emerging markets. De-risked = utility commitment, full entitlements, 36-mo to day 1 power. Queue-only positions valued at $0-75K/MW (not shown). Peak scarcity expected 2028-2029.
Strategic Implications: The Powered Land Opportunity
Execution capability + scarcity dynamics = asymmetric value creation window
THE THESIS SUMMARIZED
1. STRUCTURAL DEFICIT PERSISTS
30-50 GW U.S. shortfall through 2030+. Even with 30% international overspill and 
demand moderation, supply cannot catch up.
2. LOCATION DOESN'T MATTER
70-85% of AI workloads geographically flexible. Central U.S. serves continental 
demand. Pricing will converge nationally toward NoVA ceiling.
3. QUEUE ≠ VALUE
Bimodal distribution. Most positions worth ~$0. Only sites with full ingredients (utility 
commitment, end-user, entitlements) command premium.
4. CAPABILITY IS THE MOAT
Perhaps 10-20 organizations can execute the parallel sprint. Scarcity of execution 
capability, not land, drives value.

TIMING WINDOWS
2025-2026: Maximum Arbitrage
Entry at 25-35% of NoVA. Early movers secure best sites, relationships, utility priority.
2027-2029: Peak Scarcity
Maximum supply-demand gap. Premium valuations. Delivery in this window captures 
scarcity premium.
2030+: Convergence/Equilibrium
Geographic pricing converges. New supply begins clearing. First movers already 
positioned.
EXECUTION IMPERATIVES
1. End-user conversations before you need them
2. Utility relationships at institutional level
3. Community/political trust pre-built
4. Parallel execution capability (team + systems)
5. Portfolio approach for timing optionality
ILLUSTRATIVE ECONOMICS
500MW Site (2027 Exit)
Entry (early real) $100-150M
Development costs $25-50M
Exit (de-risked, mid) $550M
Development margin $350-425M
1GW Site (2028 Exit)
Entry (early real) $200-300M
Development costs $50-100M
Exit (de-risked, mid) $1.8B
Development margin $1.4-1.55B
Note: Illustrative only. Actual returns depend on execution, timing, and 
market conditions.
Bottom line: The opportunity isn't buying land — it's deploying execution capability into a structurally supply-constrained market. The 18-36 month window for maximum arbitrage is open now. Speed and relationships compound. Delay costs more 
than capital.

Appendix H: Validation Against Industry Forecasts
Cross-referencing projections with major analyst estimates
SOURCE THEIR FORECAST THIS ANALYSIS ALIGNMENT
IEA (2030) 945 TWh global DC energy 1,050-1,230 TWh (AI portion) Aligned (AI adds to base)
McKinsey (2030) 80+ GW US DC capacity 95-120 GW US stack demand Aligned (demand > capacity)
Goldman Sachs (2030) 122 GW global DC capacity 120-140 GW global (base) Close alignment
SemiAnalysis (2028) 56+ GW AI IT power 62-78 GW US stack Aligned (IT vs DC power)
Bernstein (2027) 30-35 GW AI demand 48-78 GW global Higher (CoWoS scaling)
WHY THIS ANALYSIS MAY BE HIGHER
Explicit wafer-to-power conversion through packaging constraints rather than 
extrapolating historical DC growth trends. Accounts for chip TDP increases 
(700W→1,400W+) and AI-specific infrastructure scaling.
CONSERVATIVE FACTORS
Supply constraints moderate near-term growth (CoWoS, HBM). Analysis assumes 
constraints bind through 2027. Actual deployment may lag production by 6-12 months.
KEY VALIDATION POINTS
✓ CoWoS as binding constraint (TrendForce, SemiAnalysis) ✓ HBM supply shortage through 2025 (SK Hynix) ✓ 3-7 year grid interconnection (utility data)
